## Introduction

This time Danny has put his eyes on a new business model with pizza as the new item. Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù. Danny decided that he is going to sell pizzas from now on, but he wanted a change. So he decided that he would uberize his pizza - that's what makes it Pizza Runner. This case study would involve business questions asked by Danny that requires solutions so tha he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Transformation

Table: **customer_orders**

Looking at the `customer_orders` table we can see that there are some changes that need to be done.
- the column `exclusions` have blank values or blank spaces and also contains 'null' in the form of string entered in them.
- the column `extras` also have blank values or blank spaces and also contains 'null' in the form of string entered in them.

We can clean both of these columns. The steps involved in this process are as follows:
- Create a temporary table so that original table remains retained. It is considered as a best pratice to make changes in a temporary table rather than making changes in the original table.
- Remove null values in exlusions and extras columns and replace with blank space ' ' or a null value.
